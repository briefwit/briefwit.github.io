<h2 id=0-1-0_introduction><a href="#0-1-0_introduction">Introduction</a></h2><p>&emsp;The Stanley Parable (TSP) is a short game, thus this will probably be a (relatively) short essay. The essay is structured in two parts: a description of some of the tools used to create the experience in the base game (not Ultra Deluxe, though it broadly still applies), and an interpretation of the effect they have. The separation of this line of thinking into these sections I think helps to identify what I believe is actually the (or at least one) common thread of the whole experience and how it is achieved (also I normally see mentions of one or the other, but never how both work together). I won't go into every theme present since that is beyond the scope of the essay. So suffice it to say I think the game is quite funny and juxtaposes humour with its' more serious moments well, and there is probably more to speak about if you look at the games other components & endings. Speaking of, though there is something to be gained by looking at every ending, probably, I think it would be repetitive and similarly out of scope. So I'll just assume that you've played the base game and so you will understand where else these themes appear even if I haven't explicitly called it out. Cool? Cool.</p>
<p>&emsp;Minor aside: I think determining what was intended matters less than what was chosen, if that makes sense. It matters less that this particular interpretation matches what was in the minds of the developers than the fact that each design is a deliberate one, and that these decisions compound into a coherent whole. I think looking at the consequences of the design choices which make up the game can lead to interesting interpretations even if the rationale for those choices is not something we can predict easily. So this essay is about the effects of those decisions, rather than intention.</p>
<p>&emsp;With the preamble out of the way, here is a very late to the party look at The Stanley Parable (2013), and the contradictions inherent to the experience.</p>

<h2 id=0-2-0_discrete_choices><a href="#0-2-0_discrete_choices">Discrete Choices</a></h2><p>&emsp;TSP is, essentially, a maze. The maze has multiple exits, each with a different reward (new ending, more dialogue from the Narrator, jokes, etc.) and things to do along the way. Finding all the games secrets then becomes a puzzle. The easiest group of inputs you could define for this game is WASD keys and a left click  for occasionally interacting with the environment. </p>
<p>&emsp;This incredibly limited interaction-space<sup>[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-0" id="footnote-0-ret">0</a>]</sup>, I'd argue, is the point. The scope probably helps in the development side of things, but it manages to shape the experience as well. The player can only do so much and in being presented with an incredibly small and discrete<sup>[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-1" id="footnote-1-ret">1</a>]</sup> number of choices makes each choice seem more significant.</p>
<p>&emsp;To highlight this point I'd like you to imagine a typical shooter. You probably have multiple guns, a grenade maybe, and ammo. The ammo for each weapon limits your choices from being basically infinite. That being said, you are unlikely to register the choice as a particularly meaningful one. One component can certainly be because in most encounters the two possible outcomes are either winning or losing, but I would argue that more fundamentally it is also due to the fact that the interaction-space is continuous rather than discrete.</p>
<p>&emsp;To develop this idea, picture the interaction-space of this typical shooter. At any given moment you can stand still, shoot, move, shoot at an explosive, aim at a target, heal yourself, and many more combinations thereof. Because of this, though you may register that you are choosing to engage in any particular action and that this is part of some strategy, the choice does not feel like a fundamental one, or a meaningful one. Even if somehow engaging with these mechanics can lead to more than one outcome (say, a teammate may live or die,  or you lose and start over) it is the discreteness of those outcomes which the player will more likely care about than the act of getting there. The meaningful choice they'd be engaging in, I'd argue, is more so whether they go out of their way to change their strategy to save the teammate or ignore them and hope for the best.</p>
<p>&emsp;TSP, on the other hand, limits player action so that the only thing which would typically be called a mechanic would be the choices. By massively restricting the interaction-space the choices are thus the only way for the player to engage with the game and therefore excursive agency. To quote the Narrator [insert quote about how game cant continue without making any choice].  Since each choice then becomes a deliberate exercise in agency, the experience is that of exploring that maze of options. </p>
<p>&emsp;The game seems to parody this idea in the beginning of the Confusion Endings where the first sign of something being wrong is when there are more than two doors in the first room (ironically, though it means more choice, they are all connected and lead to the same places).</p>
<p>&emsp;One possible counterargument to this could be that it is the permanence of consequence that causes this recognition of supposedly meaningful agency. I’m sure that helps, but let’s follow through this line of logic. Having more or less ammo in your gun, and thus more than enough or less to beat the level with just that gun is itself a consequence, but not a particularly important consequence since you can always reload or find more ammo. What about a theoretical first-person shooter where you get guns full of ammo, and you cannot reload them. That is, each gun has a finite amount of ammo in the whole game, and all of it is already in the gun. Wouldn’t running out be a permanent consequence? But then we wrapped back around from a continuous consequence to a discrete one! Either the gun is not empty or it is and is gone forever. The reason the strategy becomes important is through the introduction of a countable number of end-states. By making a consequence permanent, it is automatically discrete since there is no such game which has a truly infinite number of permanent consequences. That would be a game with infinite size, which is impossible. There is probably more room for discussion as it relates to this however I think the point has been made.</p>
<p>&emsp;To clarify about discreteness, it isn't that the number of choices being small is the point. It is the fact that choice in TSP is almost universally discrete. There is no in-between of choosing the left door from the right. It is always either picking one particular path towards an ending or another. You could argue at any given second you can stand still or backtrack, but I'm talking about meaningful interactions. Either you interact with the games surroundings or you are progressing to the next choice/next section of a given ending. </p>
<p>&emsp;This serves a dual purpose of the previously described creation of agency (which will be explored further in the interpretation section) and making the player pay attention to the context of each choice. To the latter point, if the player is totally disengaged, at no point does any part of experience stick out to them. Meanwhile, I'm sure many players remember seeing the don't-kill-yourself sign, promptly do so, and felt like their agency was recognised in being made fun of for making that choice. This aspect helps the game, since it is certainly trying to cause a meaningful experience. The discreteness of choice thus provides the player with opportunities to personalise a particular run of the "maze".</p>
<p>&emsp;Minor aside for this point before moving on: the minor interactables (computer screens, answering the Future Happiness Foundation message, etc.) incentives player to pay attention to nooks and crannies. These minor additions to the interaction-space leads to players being rewarded with more TSP, and more likely to pay attention when exploring what it has to offer.</p>

<h3 id=0-2-1_brevity_and_small_interaction-space><a href="#0-2-1_brevity_and_small_interaction-space">Brevity and Small Interaction-space</a></h3><p>&emsp;The game itself isn't particularly long. Seeing every ending (in the base game, Ultra Deluxe not included) will probably take 3 hours if you don't rush it, and every secret not long after. The longest part of the game is probably the Go Outside achievement. </p>
<p>&emsp;This level of brevity, I feel, helps in crafting the experience in three ways: the game does not overstay its' welcome; the game is short and thus more time can be spent refining what content there is; and the game has few places where the player can exercise agency through the aforementioned choices – meaning the developers can predict player action more and tailor the dialogue and endings to those limited actions. This can be seen in how often when people play the game blind, after experiencing a few endings, they try to see what the game failed to account for (what if I jump out of this window? What if I never enter the passcode? What if I choose to jump from the conveyor line?).</p>
<p>&emsp;To the point of refining each path because of brevity, the bucket endings and small secrets (dog mode, broom closet, etc.) feel like additions that can be done precisely because it almost doubles the number of endings (which are themselves barely a dozen) and (once again on the point of discrete choices) you always either do or do not have The Bucket with you. This isn't to say the game was easy to make. The point is the focused scope through brevity of length for each ending and discreteness of choices succeeds in making the game feel dense, and so doing makes the player feel constantly rewarded for looking for non-ending-related details (messages on white boards, loose sheets, etc.).</p>
<p>&emsp;Alright, I think that's everything I think is noteworthy about the craft of the game (that isn't just describing dialogue and writing techniques). </p>

<h2 id=0-3-0_interpretation><a href="#0-3-0_interpretation">Interpretation</a></h2><p>&emsp;(NB: If there is one thing I don't want this to become is "The Stanley Parable: EXPLAINED". This is just a through-line I noticed that I haven't seen many people discuss often, or at least explicitly).</p>
<p>&emsp;To say the game is self-aware is an understatement. Every ending minus one (the Freedom Ending) makes some reference to the fact that the game is a game, Stanley is an avatar for the real person playing the game, the Narrator is just another creation of the developers and has about as much control over things as you do (I'd argue less, since at least the player chooses which ending to pursue), and also to the wider world of games. Sometimes more than one of these appear at once.</p>
<p>&emsp;This is all to say that I think it is important to then see the game through the lens of it being a self-reflexive<sup>[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-2" id="footnote-2-ret">2</a>]</sup> look at the medium itself. There are other ways to look at the game, of course: comedic, narrative, etc. But I think looking at it in this way reveals how the game deals with one particular theme: control between a developer and a player over a game.</p>

<h3 id=0-3-1_the_stories_we_tell_about_games><a href="#0-3-1_the_stories_we_tell_about_games">The Stories We Tell About Games</a></h3><p>&emsp;Most metafiction which is self-reflexive presents that it is so by signalling that it is aware of the expectations and tropes of the genre or medium, and sometimes by subverting it. Bear with me, I promise I am going somewhere with this. Slaughterhouse Five’s subversion as a self-reflexive story is non-linearity. From the first chapter (not as a preamble, but labelled as “Chapter 1” of the story, showing that it is important to understand the text) the author reveals himself to you to remove the pretension that the story is real. From that point on, any time the story diverts from what you would expect (jumping around the timeline, for instance) it becomes an opportunity for the reader to question the point. This isn’t going to be an analysis of Slaughterhouse Five, but I hope it is clear how a work of fiction can introduce more meaning through signalling it is self-reflexive. </p>
<p>&emsp;In TSP, it can be argued that the first moment (if the player had not downloaded the Demo beforehand) that the game reveals its’ hand is the second the player disobeys the Narrator. Following any particular path, whatever choice you make which is not what the Narrator wants leads to him criticising the player, mocking them, or attempting to influence them to continue down the intended path. This antagonism is the first hint of self-reflection. The usual trope of the omniscient Narrator is subverted in these moments of disobedience since the Narrator cannot possibly predict which ending you will go down in any particular playthrough. In subverting, which in part is done for comedic effect, the Narrator becomes another personality with goals of his own. This personality, then, in the role of the person meant to control the experience is meant then to remind the player of the artificiality of the whole experience. This primes them to see the Narrator as the creator of the experience (within the fiction of the game) and Stanley as either themselves or as the generic player of this game. Depending on the ending the Narrator has more or less influence over things, but in general this is more or less how he is seen.</p>
<p>&emsp;In purposefully removing suspension of disbelief, the game causes the player to see the game through the self-reflexive lens, as though it is aware of itself as a game and the expectations and fictions we have about how games usually are. It has no interest in pretending to be a grounded narrative – the real narrative is the one above the established world of the story (Stanley and the office are thus the intended story, with the actual narrative the player engages with being the construction of that story by the Narrator)<sup>[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-3" id="footnote-3-ret">3</a>]</sup>. Though some may say the game breaks peoples brains or confuses them on purpose (which to be fair, it does disorient the player consciously at many points) it is actually really accessible as meta-fiction. There is not a moment in the narrative (which is not the Freedom Ending obtained by obeying the Narrator) where the game allows you to forget it is a crafted experience. It is precisely because of this that makes this game, though short and with no difficulty in traditional terms, is a game that can only be made and played by games-literate<sup>[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-4" id="footnote-4-ret">4</a>]</sup> people. The game makes jokes about the game offering commentary into the nature of games, or in the Broom Closet where it says that the next person to play requires to have some idea about the tropes in gaming so that the experience is not lost on them. To borrow a phrase from author Cory Doctorow, though these are presented as jokes, they seem to me like “Ha-ha-only-serious” jokes. It is the game making light of itself by accurately describing itself.</p>
<p>&emsp;So we made it clear that TSP actively wants the player to see it through a self-reflexive lens. And if the player succeeds in recognising this, then given the particular way it does it (e.g., having Narrator criticize player’s agency, or presenting the Narrator as auteur with a vision for his story) then it suggests TSP wants to offer insight into the stories we tell about player agency in games.</p>

<h3 id=0-3-2_contradictions><a href="#0-3-2_contradictions">Contradictions</a></h3><p>&emsp;To say the game deals in contradictions is (also) an understatement. The promotional material for the HD Remake claims both more and fewer endings, to name one. Though it is easy to see it as the game being fun and quirky, the games effect can probably be best seen when taking the games many contradictions as serious and intentional.</p>
<p>&emsp;But first let's look at something which is certainly not contradictory at any point of the game: the theme of control. Every ending deals in control. Seriously. When you kill yourself it is Stanley trying to control the narrative. When you free yourself from mind control (by listening to everything the Narrator says) you are no longer under its' control. When you try to escape at the last minute and listen to the Super-Narrator (better name pending) they specifically call out how both Stanley and the Narrator are vying for control from one another. This last one I think is particularly revealing and, as we work up to it in the coming paragraphs, I think will reveal some of where the game is ultimately pointing to with this theme.</p>

<h3 id=0-3-3_the_player_wants_influence><a href="#0-3-3_the_player_wants_influence">The player wants influence</a></h3><p>&emsp;Exclusively engaging in discrete choices throughout the game, as mentioned previously, creates agency. If there was some kind of continuous choice (like an inventory of things to interact with the world) it would be unnecessary fat to what the story/stories is/are trying to do. Since the game wants to engage with the player agency's as something to be reviewed, exclusively providing choices which provide meaningful agency aids in this end. </p>
<p>&emsp;Let's take a look at the Real Person ending. In it the Narrator berates you for being a "real person" and how the player exercising the wrong kind of agency (i.e. playing game wrong) is ruining the experience. At one point in this path, he even says it "ruined [his] work". But at the very end, when the credits roll, you are removed from the role of Stanley. You are stuck watching the Narrator desperately trying to get you to make any choice,  even a wrong one. The implication is very clear: Stanley is the one who actually has any control. Stanley chooses when to start and stop the game, and Stanley choices when to follow the intended story or not. </p>
<p>&emsp;If the game was just this ending and the Freedom ending I do not think it would have become the classic it is.  This interpretation, while valid in isolation, is very much contradicted by the Blue Door ending.</p>

<h3 id=0-3-4_the_designer_gives_influence_meaning><a href="#0-3-4_the_designer_gives_influence_meaning">The designer gives influence meaning</a></h3><p>&emsp;The Blue Door ending is the result of the player trying to fight the Narrator and trying to break from the intended path (much like in Real Person). However the final consequence leaves a very different implication. The player is jumped from game to game (Minecraft and Portal in the HD Remix, Firewatch and Rocket League in Ultra Deluxe) before they succeed going  out of bounds. The ruins the player sees suggest lack of control from the Narrator. (who cares about presentation and control himself), and that the player is finally free from him. But what is the reward for this freedom? Roaming the halls of an old version of the office from the original Half-Life mod. Supposedly forever. The Narrator then says that he wonders if Stanley (i.e. the player) is happy having seen the consequence of what they wanted. </p>
<p>&emsp;Once again the implication feels very clear, though mutually exclusive to the one from the Real Person ending. If Stanley in this ending is a stand-in for the player, then the Narrator acts as the developer of TSP.  He has only built the experience the player is meant to see, and the players insistence to go out of bounds at every turn is depicted as childish for not being satisfied with the base game (instead of being a sign of control like in Real Person). This is basically explicit in the Ultra Deluxe version of the ending.</p>
<p>&emsp;Seeing rebellion as childish then influences how this ending is interpreted: the player wanted freedom from the developer whatever the cost, now they got it and get to spend forever in a meaningless out of bound area. Then the conclusion's ominous message is that the Narrator is required to make the experience work, more so than Stanley. Without the clearly defined barriers of the game, acting in it is like reading an infinitely long book. It may contain every combination of words possible, but it is meaningless without intent. Likewise a game where you can do literally everything (pay taxes, kill someone, become president, make a game, whatever) is meaningless. The Narrator thus becomes very necessary for the whole experience to work, implicitly criticising Stanley (you) for trying so hard to break it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Okay. We have two mostly mutually exclusive endings. What now? </p>

<h3 id=0-3-5_a_parable><a href="#0-3-5_a_parable">A Parable</a></h3><p>&emsp;One sentiment that appears a lot when discussing this game is that, whilst funny, the player feels some sense of dread. The initial office has a random chance of changing, the Narrator's dialogue is altered sometimes, etc. While what I listed certainly helps in building this sentiment (randomness in a place you thought was safe from the shenanigans of the endings will do that), I'd additionally say that the lack of resolution from the contradictions adds to this feeling. </p>
<p>&emsp;In fact, one way to interpret the name of the game is precisely as that conflict. It is a Parable about the nature of games, and where control resides in crafting the experience and, by extension, meaning. This conflict between the Narrator and Stanley could be described as a dialectic, even, if there was someone on God's green Earth that actually knew what that means.</p>
<p>&emsp;How do we resolve the conflict? Quit, and never come back. That's the explicit message of the Museum Ending. You want freedom? Want to be free of the illusion of choice? You don't win the conflict in a satisfying way as a player by going out of bounds. The Narrator doesn't win by removing all agency from the player. So long as this is true, the tension will never cease.</p>
<p>&emsp;How do you win? The only winning move is not to play.</p>

<h2 id=0-4-0_conclusion_pt.1:_the_end_is_never_the_end_is_never...><a href="#0-4-0_conclusion_pt.1:_the_end_is_never_the_end_is_never...">Conclusion Pt.1: The end is never the end is never...</a></h2><p>&emsp;The Stanley Parable lives in contradictions. It is very much one of its' defining characteristics. I don't think it is trying to resolve any in a satisfying way, which is to be expected in a game that has no singular definitive ending. Very postmodern. This essay could have just been a summary of a few endings and the conclusion would have been the same but what is important, I feel, is seeing how the games structure sets up the premises for the endings and seeing how this structure plays into the themes in them.</p>
<p>&emsp;In particular, the key theme of agency in games, showing how every game lives in this contradictory space (both intensely linear games and ones which offer total freedom (Portal and Minecraft for example)), and to bring this awareness to the player. That is why the discreteness of choice is important. It allows the player to feel some agency, so that when it deals in these themes it causes the player to reflect on the nature and consequences of that limited agency. It also critically uses the creation of recognisable agency in the player to trigger the self-reflexive view of what the game does at every point. It is a game that actively wants you think on its’ level: since the point about agency can only be made with, you know, an agent, the game cannot become a dialogue about agency without you understanding the role you are playing in it.</p>
<p>&emsp;Thus, by having the player understand that to explore the game they must play an adversarial role at times with the Narrator, it enables the player to not just see but understand one of the takeaways: that tension between developer and player will remain a fundamental part of the medium, never to be resolved. </p>

<h2 id=0-5-0_conclusion_pt.2:_why_did_i_write_this?><a href="#0-5-0_conclusion_pt.2:_why_did_i_write_this?">Conclusion Pt.2: Why did I write this?</a></h2><p>&emsp;Why did I decide to spend 4000+ words on a game from 2013, especially given there is more to talk about with the remake Ultra Deluxe? The Stanley Parable was the first game I ever played which wasn’t trying to just be fun. There are things to analyse in a mainline Mario game, such as the role of mechanics and feel of those mechanics to the mature and the new player, but at the end of the day the structure of most (maybe even all) Nintendo games is fun first, anything else second. It isn’t bad to want your game to be fun, but for me it was hard to imagine a game that made me feel the same way as a really good book where themes and structure worked together to create an experience. Games seemed to be split into two halves: the story and the mechanics; both could be good or bad but experiencing one felt simply tangentially related to the other. </p>
<p>&emsp;Portal 2, for example, is a good first-person puzzle game and a fun story. But the setting of the game could have been different and the overall mechanical experience would be the same (solving puzzle after puzzle, making linear progress towards the end). It’s a good game! But either half could have been changed and it would not take very much effort relatively speaking to make the changed-half work with the other. TSP, for me anyway, was the first game I played where I recognised the mechanical structure was inherently tied to the narrative being told. It helped me see how games can use structure for narrative purposes in a way any other medium could not. </p>
<p>&emsp;There is so much more to write about: such as the use of comedy to eleviate tension and highlight it, the commentary in multiple paths about the relationship between the player and their desire to see more content, etc. However I just wanted to follow the agency theme in this essay.</p>
<p>&emsp;If I never write another essay about video games, I’m glad my first and last was dedicated to this game.</p>

<h2 id=0-6-0_footnotes><a href="#0-6-0_footnotes">Footnotes</a></h2><p id="footnote-0">[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-0-ret">0</a>]&ensp;I think this is a very useful term for describing every possible combination of things the player can (meaningfully) do given the mechanics. If the mechanics are that you can run and jump, then the interaction-space is every non-trivial combination of runs + jumps you can do in the level. If you have studied linear algebra, think of mechanics like vectors and interaction-spaces like vector spaces.</p>
<p id="footnote-1">[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-1-ret">1</a>]&ensp;Discrete, meaning not continuous. So if a spectrum from blue to red is continuous since there an infinite amount of colours between, choosing between a red ball and a blue ball is discrete since there is a countable (two) number of choices.</p>
<p id="footnote-2">[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-2-ret">2</a>]&ensp;Self-reflexive means that a work is aware of itself. Think a book that makes allusions to the fact that it has been written (e.g. Slaughterhouse Five), or a game that calls out the player for something they did in the game (e.g. The Stanley Parable). If you like, just replace every mention of self-reflexive with ‘meta’ in the casual sense and it more-or-less means the same thing.</p>
<p id="footnote-3">[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-3-ret">3</a>]&ensp;Small aside. Thinking like this, the game offers a fictional layer above the base story which allows for it to engaged in a controlled look at its’ themes while still be self-reflexive. Having the game be self-reflexive, but not name Crows Crows Crows by name, or Wreden, or Pugh, invites the player to think of the game as a meta-fiction without complicating the experience with analysing the real-world people that actually made the game. Which I think is noteworthy, since The Beginner’s Guide does the opposite! It is intensionally self-reflexive (Wreden the real-world developer voices Wreden the narrator, and the narrator pretends to be one and the same with the developer as though the story wasn’t fictional), but when the games narrative reveals itself slowly, it causes confusion in most players in trying to split what is obviously fictional to what isn’t. I’m not saying that this is a failure of either TSP or the Beginner’s Guide either way, I just think the juxtaposition between both is interesting (and worthy of whole essay, probably).</p>
<p id="footnote-4">[<a class= "alink" href="#footnote-4-ret">4</a>]&ensp;We often talk about literacy as though it only means that you can read the words from a page. It can extend to understanding the tropes of the media you consume. You can say someone is book-literate if when they notice a typo in a work they can tell whether it is intentional or not based on the surrounding text. That literacy can then be seen as pattern recognition, which enables us to engage with a common language of a particular medium. TSP does not appear to be rebelling against the restrictions of this game-language, but it is employed purposefully such that the player then becomes aware of it if they weren't before. Hence what I mean about it being very accessible despite being more involved narratively than the average game of the time.</p>
